It then initializes a list of stacks (bigList) to represent the bottles and fills them with random color combinations using the FillStacksWithColors method.
The main game loop allows the user to move a color from one bottle to another using the MoveElement method.
The current state of the bottles is displayed using the PrintMove method after each move.
